# poe-apps.pipelines

This application is less an application and more a collection of
services for other applications. As such, its integrant system is only
useful for testing.

It was originally imported from the
[poe-info](https://github.com/atamis/poe-info), and haven't been
integrated into poe-apps or integrant.
